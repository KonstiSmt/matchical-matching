## ICP mapping

- primary_icp: ICP 1 (Consultancy Core System)
- secondary_icp: ICP 3 (Framework Orchestrator)
- low_priority_icp: ICP 2 (External Staffing Agency)
- confidence: medium-high
- note: partner management exists, but "Durchleitgeschaeft" is priority 3 per call notes.

## Key confirmed signals

- Group-level scale around 1,300 employees.
- Core market focus is banking and insurance (about 80 percent of business).
- Strong integration context after multi-entity consolidation.
- Key account structure with dedicated KAM team.
- Public-sector-adjacent footprint via development-bank and framework-contract context.

## Current pains

- CV and skill data quality is inconsistent.
- Availability and profile freshness require manual clarification loops.
- BRM and KAM handoffs are still heavy in manual effort.
- Submission quality requires repeated "buzzword" and wording adjustments.

## Buying context

- Primary functional sponsor candidate: Steven Hartmann (Director, Co-Lead KAM and Partner Management).
- Likely internal stakeholders: KAM leadership, BRM/staffing operations, sales leadership.
- Economic decision likely tied to wider sales leadership and integration priorities.

## Next checkpoints

- Validate current volume split by profile business vs project business.
- Validate where trial should start (KAM-owned use case vs BRM-owned use case).
- Define pilot KPI baseline: time-to-shortlist, rework loops, submission quality consistency.
