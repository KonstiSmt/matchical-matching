# Meeting notes - x1F x matchical

## Meeting metadata

- date: 2026-02-23
- type: discovery and product walkthrough
- participants:
  - Konsti (matchical)
  - Steven Hartmann (x1F)

## Summary

x1F confirms strong fit around CV/skill-data quality, faster matching, and higher-quality submission output. The strongest active use case is internal profile business and key-account execution, not a partner-throughput-first model.

## Confirmed takeaways

- x1F has integrated multiple legacy entities and is now in continuous post-merger change mode.
- Business mix appears heavily profile-driven in current operating reality.
- KAM has dedicated structure and ownership for strategic customer development.
- Public-sector-adjacent business exists through framework-style setups in development-bank contexts.
- Existing CV tooling is in place, but quality and process consistency are not yet where x1F wants them.

## Process signals from call

- Incoming requests are often small and operationally dense.
- BRM and KAM handoffs involve manual checks for profile quality and availability.
- Final CV output usually needs manual wording/tailoring before submission.
- Salesforce is active in the process and relevant for integration.

## ICP interpretation after call

- ICP 1: primary fit (internal consultant-profile operations at scale).
- ICP 3: secondary fit (key-account orchestration and framework-style contexts).
- ICP 2: lower fit currently (freelancer/throughput is not top priority).

## Potential pilot scope

- Start with one KAM-led account flow.
- Measure request-to-shortlist speed and number of rework loops.
- Include CV-template output quality as explicit KPI.
