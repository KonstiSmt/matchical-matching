# Epic: Open Search

## Confirmed Facts
- Open Search is a planned feature (not current/live state).
- Purpose: search consultants without requiring a specific demand object.
- Intended query dimensions include role, skill, certificate, and other profile attributes.
- Intended use: internal search/discovery across consultant pool for staffing workflows.

## Assumptions
- Ranking/scoring logic for Open Search may partially reuse matching logic from demand-based flows.

## Notes
- Define final UX, filter model, and ranking behavior before implementation.
- Add dependencies and rollout plan once product scope is finalized.
