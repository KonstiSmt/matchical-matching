# Roadmap Overview

Future-state features and epics are tracked here, separate from current-state capability docs.

## Confirmed Facts
- Roadmap content should contain planned/future state only.
- Current/live capability descriptions belong in product/company/market files.
- `Open Search` is a planned feature and should be tracked as an epic.

## Assumptions
- Additional epics will be added incrementally with one file per epic.

## Notes
- Current roadmap epics:
  - [Epic: Open Search](./epic-open-search.md)
  - [Epic: Project Layer](./epic-project-layer.md)
