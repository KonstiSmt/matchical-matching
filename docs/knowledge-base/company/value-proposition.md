# Value Proposition

## Confirmed Facts
- Matchical combines domain-specific workflow software with controlled AI acceleration.
- AI acceleration is part of the value proposition, but not the only value proposition.
- Matchical is specialized for consultancies and external staffing agencies in high-skilled consulting staffing workflows.
- Matchical is intentionally niche-focused instead of broad generic ERP or general ATS tooling.
- Matchical improves speed and quality in demand response and candidate submission workflows.
- Matchical supports structured consultant-demand matching and template/language-specific CV export.
- Matchical is not a generic ERP replacement.

## Assumptions
- None currently after this review pass.

## Notes
- Message-performance priorities (which phrasing converts best) are still hypothesis-level and must be validated in sales experiments.
