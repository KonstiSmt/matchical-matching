# ICP 1: Consultancy Core System

Consultancies that use Matchical as a core internal operating system for consultant data, demand matching, and submission output.

## Confirmed Facts
### Company Archetype
- Consultancy organizations that manage internal consultant pools and need reliable internal deployment workflows.
- Internal-first focus.

### Primary Users
- Sales operations and adjacent teams running consultant-data and demand workflows.

### Buying Center and Decision Roles
- Chief executives are typically involved in final purchase decisions for this ICP because the scope is business-critical.

### Core Jobs-to-be-Done
- Maintain structured internal consultant data.
- Parse opportunities or demands and run internal matching.
- Produce customer-ready CV outputs across required templates and languages.

### Product-Capability Focus
- Structured consultant profile management.
- Opportunity and demand parsing support.
- Internal search and matching workflows.
- CV export workflows.
- Consultant profile structure includes skills, roles, certificates, languages, education, training, and project or engagement context.

### Common Pre-Matchical Setup
- In-house or custom-built solutions (especially around skill or role management).
- Generic market tools are present in some cases but are often seen as poor fit for this operating model.

### Known Objections
- Price sensitivity, especially with AI-enabled capabilities.
- Mindset objection in some consultancies: "we sell projects/solutions, not consultants," which can delay adoption intent.

## Assumptions
- Primary buying trigger is internal consultant management and deployment efficiency.
- Relative importance of cycle-time improvement versus output-quality improvement is not yet fully validated.
- Urgency patterns are mixed and cannot yet be standardized for this ICP.

### Draft Trigger Signals (to validate)
- Hiring signals or organizational signals around sales operations, resource management, or staffing operations in consulting environments.
- Clear evidence that the firm operates consultant-profile and demand-submission workflows at consultancy scale.
- Messaging around staffing speed, utilization pressure, or submission throughput bottlenecks.
- Signals of fragmented legacy setup (custom tools and manual handoffs) around consultant data and demand workflows.

### Draft Title Priority (to validate)
- First contact:
  - Head/Lead Sales Operations
  - Resource Manager
  - Head of Staffing Operations
  - Practice Operations Lead
- Economic buyer/final decision:
  - Chief executive roles
  - Managing Director or COO (where applicable)

### First-Draft Lead Scoring (ICP 1)
- Gate criteria:
  - DACH geography.
  - Consultancy operating model.
  - Not in non-fit boundaries from ICP overview.
- Scoring draft (100 total):
  - Consultancy delivery model with consultant deployment operations: 30
  - Evidence of at least ~50 consultants: 20
  - Relevant title match (first-contact or buyer roles): 20
  - Trigger-signal strength (workflow pain and process complexity): 20
  - Clear absence of non-fit indicators: 10
- Draft qualification threshold: 65+

## Notes
### Scope Clarification
- External sourcing-heavy workflows should be treated primarily under ICP 2 due to different operating teams and buying centers.

### Suggested Validation Focus
- Measure impact on consultant data quality, internal matching speed, and submission preparation effort during trial and proof-of-concept phases.
