# Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) Overview

## Confirmed Facts
- Matchical currently operates with three behavior-based ICP modes.
- These ICP modes are distinct for analysis and messaging.
- One customer organization can map to one, two, or all three ICP modes at the same time.
- Different ICP modes can involve different buying centers and decision makers.
- Core non-fit boundaries:
  - Permanent-recruiting ATS workflows.
  - Low-skill temporary labor staffing models.

## Assumptions
- None currently after this review pass.

## Notes
### Hypothesis-Level Items (to validate)
- Buying-trigger hierarchy across ICP modes is still hypothesis-level and should be validated through sales and lead-gen experiments.
