# ICP 3: Framework Orchestrator

Organizations that operate as framework-contract coordinators and orchestrate partner-network submissions.

## Confirmed Facts
### Company Archetype
- Organizations that hold or operate within framework-contract structures and coordinate partner-based fulfillment.

### Primary Users
- Key account managers and framework-contract operating teams.

### Buying Center and Decision Roles
- Decision ownership can be led by the key account manager or by the framework-contract day-to-day product owner.
- Team-level operational stakeholders are typically involved due to coordination-heavy workflows.

### Core Jobs-to-be-Done
- Receive framework demand requests.
- Dispatch or route demands to partner channels.
- Collect shortlist options from partner and internal sources.
- Execute final review/final polish and choose final submissions.

### Product-Capability Focus
- Partner management and orchestration workflows.
- Demand intake, routing, and shortlist consolidation.
- Final review/final polish support before submission.
- Internal active sourcing can exist, but orchestration and partner management are the core.

### Known Objections
- Price sensitivity may appear, especially when AI-enabled capability scope is discussed.

## Assumptions
- Primary buying trigger is orchestration efficiency plus final review/final polish accountability.
- Urgency levels and trigger hierarchy are still mixed and not yet standardized.
- KPI priority before purchase is not stable enough to standardize.

### Draft Trigger Signals (to validate)
- Evidence of framework-contract or public-client coordination context (more often via roles, tenders, or operating descriptions than marketing headlines).
- Signals of partner-network coordination, vendor/supplier routing, or submission-orchestration workflows.
- Evidence that shortlist consolidation and final selection/polish is a central operating step.
- Key-account pressure around rapid, high-quality response for framework demand cycles.

### Draft Title Priority (to validate)
- First contact:
  - Key Account Manager (especially public-sector context)
  - Framework Contract Manager
  - Partner Manager
  - Bid/Proposal Lead
- Economic buyer/final decision:
  - BU lead or managing director
  - Chief executive roles in some account contexts

### First-Draft Lead Scoring (ICP 3)
- Gate criteria:
  - DACH geography.
  - Framework-orchestration operating model.
  - Not in non-fit boundaries from ICP overview.
- Scoring draft (100 total):
  - Framework/public-client orchestration evidence: 35
  - Partner-network coordination evidence: 25
  - Relevant title match (first-contact or buyer roles): 20
  - Evidence of shortlist consolidation/final review flow: 10
  - Clear absence of non-fit indicators: 10
- Draft qualification threshold: 65+

## Notes
### Suggested Validation Focus
- Measure partner-response coordination speed, shortlist quality consistency, and final submission decision effort during trial and proof-of-concept phases.
