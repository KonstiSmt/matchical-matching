# ICP 3: Framework Orchestrator

Organizations that operate as framework-contract coordinators and orchestrate partner-network submissions.

## Confirmed Facts
- Primary goal: coordinate and orchestrate demand fulfillment across partner networks.
- Typical operating pattern:
  - Receive demand requests from framework-contract clients.
  - Dispatch/select partner channels.
  - Collect shortlist candidates from partners and internal sources.
  - Perform final review/final polish and choose final submission set.
- Internal active sourcing can exist, but orchestration and partner management are core.

## Assumptions
- None currently after this review pass.

## Notes
### Hypothesis-Level Items (to validate)
- Potential buying trigger: partner-management orchestration layer plus final review/final polish responsibility.

### Current Reference Context
