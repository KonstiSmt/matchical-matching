# ICP 2: External Staffing Agency

External staffing-focused teams that source and place external consultants or freelancers against incoming consultant demands.

## Confirmed Facts
### Company Archetype
- Standalone staffing agencies.
- Dedicated external staffing units inside larger consultancies.

### Primary Users
- Recruiters and staffing operators who run day-to-day sourcing, matching, and submission workflows.

### Buying Center and Decision Roles
- In most cases, chief executives are involved in final purchase decisions.
- This ICP is often smaller in initial scope than ICP 1, but executive involvement still occurs.

### Core Jobs-to-be-Done
- Build and maintain external consultant pools.
- Parse incoming demand documents.
- Match candidates against demand requirements.
- Produce optimized submission CVs quickly.

### Product-Capability Focus
- Demand parsing and requirement extraction.
- Matching across external consultant pools.
- CV export and optimization workflows (including glow-up positioning where relevant).
- Job-board posting and automated inbound application ingestion are planned, not current.

### Common Pre-Matchical Setup
- Generic staffing or applicant-tracking tools for parts of the process.
- Processes with significant manual steps across sourcing, qualification, and submission preparation.

### Known Objections
- Price sensitivity, including concerns that AI capabilities increase software cost.

## Assumptions
- Primary buying trigger is speed-quality efficiency in external demand response.
- Urgency is often linked to demand spikes and CV bottlenecks, but exact trigger ranking is not yet validated.
- KPI priority before purchase is not stable enough to standardize.

### Draft Trigger Signals (to validate)
- Explicit language around freelancers, external consultants, or partner-based consultant sourcing.
- Recruiter-heavy team signals in a project-consultant staffing context (excluding permanent-recruiting-first context).
- Public-client or tender-response context signals (for example key-account public-sector staffing and proposal pressure).
- Messaging around staffing speed, response time, and shortlisting bottlenecks.

### Draft Title Priority (to validate)
- First contact:
  - Head of Recruiting
  - Team Lead Recruiting
  - Staffing Manager
  - Freelancer Manager
- Additional relevant contact points:
  - Partner Manager
  - Key Account Manager (especially public-sector demand context)
- Economic buyer/final decision:
  - Chief executive roles
  - Managing Director

### First-Draft Lead Scoring (ICP 2)
- Gate criteria:
  - DACH geography.
  - External staffing operating model.
  - Not in non-fit boundaries from ICP overview.
- Scoring draft (100 total):
  - External staffing/freelancer placement model evidence: 30
  - Recruiter/staffing team evidence (including small-team setup): 20
  - Relevant title match (first-contact or buyer roles): 20
  - Trigger-signal strength (speed bottleneck or demand-response pressure): 20
  - Clear absence of non-fit indicators: 10
- Draft qualification threshold: 60+

## Notes
### Suggested Validation Focus
- Measure time-to-shortlist, submission throughput, and proposal quality consistency during trial and proof-of-concept phases.
