# ICP 2: External Staffing Agency

External staffing-focused teams that source and place external consultants or freelancers against incoming consultant demands.

## Confirmed Facts
- Primary goal: respond to external demands quickly with high-quality shortlist and submission outcomes.
- Key workflow emphasis:
  - Build and maintain external consultant database.
  - Parse incoming demand documents.

  - Produce optimized CV submissions (including glow-up positioning where appropriate).
- This ICP can exist as:
  - A standalone staffing agency.
  - A dedicated external staffing unit inside a larger consultancy.
- Job-board posting and automated inbound application ingestion are planned, not current.
