# Engagement Description Prompt Notes

## Purpose
Keep this file as the working notes for the engagement description prompt. This is for design decisions, unresolved questions, and clarifications that should inform the prompt but do not belong inside the prompt itself.

## Current Decisions
- Engagement description should focus on the consultant’s tasks and contributions.
- General project description can be used only to clarify the consultant’s actions, not to add project-level scope.
- Predefined exclusion list is enforced across all versions.
- No bold formatting in any output.

## Open Questions
- Should engagement descriptions ever include project objectives or outcomes if not tied to the consultant’s actions?
- Do we need explicit rules for handling duplicated or conflicting items between consultant and project descriptions beyond “prefer consultant text”?
- Should we add a maximum number of bullets or paragraph length guideline?
